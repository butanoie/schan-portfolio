Buta is a shameless rip-off of Yoshi Boo, or Boo-chan, a now retired mascot for <a href=\"https://www.yoshinoya.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yoshinoya</a>, a famous chain of fast food restaurants in Japan (and other parts of the world).",

I take it the marketing folk at Yoshinoya decided the best way to promote their new pork-based menu was to create a new mascot.",

Boo-chan was all over their in-store merchandising and there was a funny TV commercial of him dressed in a tuxedo giving a press conference. Boo-chan was an easy choice to become my new avatar."
